# 分析项目管理界面（Project Management）

## Public Example
The platform will periodically select representative and valuable analysis projects as public examples for display. In these public examples, users can view all data information in the analysis interface and the visualization operation interface. However, public examples do not support user editing.

## Collaboration and sharing
When collaboration is needed, users can click the collaboration share button on the analysis task card they want to share. In the popup window, toggle the "Public" state button to the "On" position and click the quick copy link below to copy the access link for the analysis task. Other users can access and view the shared analysis task via this link, but guest users are not allowed to edit it.
